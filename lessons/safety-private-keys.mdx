## Safety: Protecting Your Private Keys

Your seed phrase \- that sequence of 12 or 24 words generated when you first create a [wallet](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/wallet) \- is the master key to your funds. It is not a password that can be reset; it is a mathematical reconstruction of your private key, and whoever holds it holds your wallet, *unconditionally*.

Think of it like this: your public address is your home address \- safe to share, so people can send things to you. Your private key is your house key. Your seed phrase is the master mold that can cut that key again from scratch. You would not leave a copy of your house key taped to your front door. The same logic applies here.

### **Best Practices**

* Write your seed phrase down by hand, on paper or metal \- never digitally  
* Store it in at least one secure, offline location (e.g. a safe, a locked drawer).  
* Consider a second physical copy stored in a separate location \- fire, flooding, and theft are real risks.  
* Never photograph it, paste it into a notes app, or store it in cloud storage like Google Drive or iCloud.  
* Never type it into any website or app that asks for it \- no legitimate platform will ever need your seed phrase.

⚠ IMPORTANT  
If anyone \- whether it is a support agent, a giveaway, or a helpful stranger \- asks for your seed phrase or private key, it is a scam. No exceptions. Jupiter support will never ask for this information.
