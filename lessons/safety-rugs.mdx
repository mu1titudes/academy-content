## Safety: Scams, Rug Pulls & Fake Tokens

Not every threat comes from a hacker trying to break into your wallet. Some of the biggest losses in crypto come from willingly investing in projects that were fraudulent from the start, or buying tokens that were designed to deceive.

### **Rug Pulls \- From Right Under You**

A rug pull occurs when the creators of a project \- usually a new [token](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/cryptocurreny) or DeFi protocol \- build up hype and liquidity, and then abruptly drain all the funds and disappear, leaving investors with worthless assets. Signs to watch for include anonymous teams with no verifiable track record, promises of extremely high guaranteed yields, no public audit from a reputable security firm, and social media accounts created very recently with artificially inflated follower counts.

### **Fake Airdrops**

You may occasionally notice unfamiliar tokens appearing in your wallet that you never asked for. These are often "dusting" attacks \- fake tokens sent to your address to lure you into interacting with a malicious contract. Do not try to swap, sell, or interact with tokens you do not recognize. Simply ignore them.

### **Verifying Token Legitimacy**

On Solana, any token can be created by anyone in minutes, and they can be named anything \- including names identical to legitimate projects. Before buying an unfamiliar token, always verify its contract address against the official project website or a reputable source like the [Jupiter Verified token list](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-portfolio).

* **Check the contract address**: The token's mint address should match the one published on the official project's website. A token named "USDC" with a different address than the real USDC mint is a fake.  
* **Look for the verified badge**: Jupiter flags verified tokens. If a token is not verified and you don't recognize it, treat it with caution.  
* **Audit status matters**: Established DeFi protocols publish security audit reports from firms like Zenith, OtterSec, or Certora. No audits is a meaningful red flag.
