## Safety: Safe Browsing Habits

Your security is only as strong as the environment you operate in. Even if you follow every other rule in this lesson, a compromised browser or a careless click can undo your efforts. Safe browsing is the final protective layer.

### **Essential Habits**

* Always bookmark official dApp URLs and access them only through those bookmarks \- never via search results, which can surface sponsored phishing links.  
* Keep your browser and Jupiter Wallet Extension updated. Security patches are released regularly and protect against known vulnerabilities.  
* Only install browser extensions from verified publishers with a significant number of users and positive reviews. Malicious wallet extensions are a common attack vector.  
* Avoid doing on-chain activity on public Wi-Fi or shared computers. If you must, use a VPN and never save credentials or leave sessions open.  
* Use a dedicated browser profile for crypto activity \- one that has no other extensions installed and is not connected to your personal accounts.

### **Using the Jupiter Extension Safely**

* The [Jupiter Browser Extension](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-pc) includes built-in protections that make safe browsing easier. Transaction simulation shows you exactly what will happen before you confirm.  
  * MEV protection routes your transactions privately to prevent front-running.  
  * Auto-Lock ensures the extension locks itself after a period of inactivity, so an unattended computer cannot become a point of vulnerability.  
* For users holding significant assets, connecting a [hardware wallet](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/wallet) to the Jupiter Extension is the gold standard. Your private keys remain completely offline, while you still benefit from the full Jupiter trading interface.
