**Jupiter Portfolio** is the unified command center for your Solana DeFi activity. Instead of manually checking multiple platforms to monitor your balances or rewards, Portfolio scans over 140 protocols in real-time to provide a single, clear view of your net worth. It's designed to help you track performance, manage open positions, and ensure you never leave "claimable" assets behind.

## Your Unified Dashboard

The primary goal of the Portfolio tool is to remove the guesswork from decentralized finance. When you connect your wallet, the dashboard automatically categorizes your assets so you can see exactly where your capital is allocated.

- **Broad Protocol Coverage:** Portfolio tracks your positions across swaps, lending vaults (including Earn), and even external yield farms
- **Claimables Detection:** One of the most practical features is the "Airdrop Checker" tracker. It scans the network for airdrops, rewards, or idle funds you may have forgotten to collect across the ecosystem
- **Net Worth History:** For a better perspective on your growth, Portfolio provides a visual history of your balance changes over time, helping you understand your long-term trends

## PnL and Performance Tracking

Professional asset management requires accurate data. Jupiter Portfolio provides detailed **Profit and Loss (PnL)** metrics so you can evaluate your strategies and track your progress.

- **Realized vs. Unrealized:** You can easily see the difference between the profits you've already secured and the current value of your active positions
- **Asset-Specific Insights:** By selecting a specific token, you can view your trading history, average entry price, and how that asset is performing relative to your overall holdings

## Privacy and Security

As with all products in the Jupiter ecosystem, the Portfolio tool is built with a focus on non-custodial principles and user safety:

- **Read-Only Access:** The portfolio tracker simply "reads" public on-chain data to display your balances. It cannot move your funds without your explicit approval in your wallet
- **Multi-Wallet Support:** You can add multiple [wallet](academy.jup.ag/lessons/wallet) addresses or domains (like .sol names) to track your entire footprint across different wallets in a single view
- **Direct Ledger Data:** All information is pulled directly from the Solana ledger, ensuring you are seeing an accurate, real-time reflection of your accounts

## Operational Execution

### Step 1: Connect and Scan

Navigate to jup.ag/portfolio. Once you connect your Solana wallet, the protocol begins a deep scan of the blockchain to identify your associated accounts and active positions.

### Step 2: Reviewing Your Positions

Scroll through the **Assets** tab to view your liquid tokens. Use the **DeFi** tab to see active stakes, loans in Jupiter Lend, or liquidity you've provided to Earn vaults.

### Step 3: Identifying Missed Rewards

Check the **"Airdrop Checker"** section regularly. If the protocol detects rewards from a recent airdrop or an older liquidity pool, you can claim them directly through the interface.
