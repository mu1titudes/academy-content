## Exploring Jupiter on PC

Jupiter is also available on desktop, in the form of a web browser extension.

The **Jupiter Browser Extension** is a high-performance desktop gateway designed to bring the full power of the Jupiter "Superapp" to your browser. While the Jupiter Mobile app offers convenience on the go, the extension is built for professional-grade trading, featuring faster execution speeds, MEV protection, and a seamless "Auto-Approve" workflow. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to installing the extension and migrating your existing mobile wallet to your desktop environment.

## Key Trading Features

Once set up, the Jupiter Extension offers several advanced tools that differentiate it from standard browser [wallets](academy.jup.ag/lessons/wallet):

- **Auto-Approve:** In the wallet settings, you can enable "Auto-Approve" for trusted sites like jup.ag. This allows you to execute swaps instantly without a confirmation pop-up for every trade
- **Transaction Simulation:** Before you sign any transaction, the extension simulates the outcome, showing exactly which tokens will leave your wallet and what you will receive
- **MEV Protection:** By default, the extension routes your trades to protect you from "sandwich attacks" and front-running, ensuring you receive the best possible price on the market

## Installation and Browser Support

The Jupiter Extension is compatible with most **Chromium-based** browsers, including Google Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge.

### Steps to Install

1. Navigate to the official Chrome Web Store and search for "Jupiter Wallet"
2. Select "Add to Chrome" (or your respective browser)
3. Once installed, click the "Puzzle Piece" icon in your browser's toolbar and pin the Jupiter Extension for immediate access

### Important Warnings

- **Firefox Status:** The Jupiter Extension for Firefox is currently a work-in-progress. For the most stable experience, use a Chromium-based browser
- **Verify Official Source:** Always ensure you are installing the official extension. Verify that the developer is listed as jup.ag and check for a high number of users and positive reviews to avoid malicious clones or phishing attempts

## Migrating from Jupiter Mobile

If you are already a Jupiter Mobile user, you don't need to create a new wallet. You can simply import your existing one to maintain a unified balance across all devices.

### Step 1: Import from Mobile to Extension

Open the Jupiter Extension in your browser and select **"Import an existing wallet"** followed by **"Jupiter Mobile"**. Follow the instructions to use your Jupiter mobile app to import your wallet into the extension.

**Alternative (Social Login):** If you originally set up your Jupiter Mobile account using an email or social account, select the "Social Login" option on the extension and sign in with the same credentials.

### Step 2: Create a Local Password

The extension will ask you to create a local password. This password is only for unlocking the extension on your current computer; it is not your recovery phrase.

## Security Best Practices

Moving to a desktop environment introduces different security considerations compared to a mobile device.

- **The "Read-Only" Rule:** The extension only reads public ledger data to show your balances. It cannot access your funds without your local password or biometrics
- **Hardware Wallet Integration:** For maximum security, you can connect a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet to the extension. This keeps your private keys entirely offline while still using the Jupiter interface for trading
- **Locking the Extension:** Always set your extension to "Auto-Lock" after a few minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access if your computer is left unattended
