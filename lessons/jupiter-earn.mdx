## Maximizing Passive Returns with Jupiter Earn

Jupiter Earn is a professional and transparent way to generate passive yield through the Jupiter Lend ecosystem. By supplying your assets to shared liquidity vaults, you provide the capital that borrowers need while earning interest based on real-time market demand. It’s a non-custodial solution designed for those who want consistent returns without having to manage complex trading strategies.

### **What Is Earn?**

Think of Earn as the supply side of the Jupiter lending engine. When you deposit assets into a vault, they are pooled together to provide liquidity for other users who want to [borrow](academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-borrow) or use leverage on the Solana network.

Earn is designed to be simple, making it easy for anyone to deposit tokens and start earning yield, and also transparent, with real-time statistics on earnings, utilization, and available liquidity.

### **Core Principles**

* **How You Earn:** Your yield (APY) is driven by "utilization." This is simply the ratio of supplied capital that is currently being borrowed. When demand from borrowers goes up, your interest rate increases.  
* **Unified Liquidity:** Jupiter Earn uses a single liquidity layer. This means your capital is automatically routed where it’s needed most to ensure you're getting a competitive market rate.  
* **Earn vs. Lending:** It’s important to remember that assets in Earn are strictly for generating yield. Unlike a standard lending pool, you **cannot** use your Earn deposits as collateral to borrow other tokens. This keeps your risk profile much simpler.

### **JL Tokens, Your Receipt Tokens**

When you make a deposit, as a form of receipt Jupiter gives you "Jupiter Lend Tokens" (like **JL-SOL** or **JL-USDC**) in return.

* **Earning Over Time:** These tokens represent your share of the vault. As borrowers pay interest, that value is added back into the pool. This means your JL Tokens actually grow in value compared to the original asset you deposited.  
* **Withdrawing:** When you’re ready to exit, you just swap your JL Tokens back for your original assets plus all the interest you’ve earned.  
* **Asset Preservation:** These JL Tokens should not be burned or discarded, as they represent your unique claim on the pool’s liquidity. Without these receipts, you cannot redeem your supplied assets.

### **Key Concepts for Stake**

* **Variable Rates:** APY isn't fixed; it moves up and down based on market supply and demand.  
* **Code Security:** You are interacting with on-chain [smart contracts](academy.jup.ag/lessons/smart-contracts). Jupiter manages this risk through multiple audits and a transparent, open-source approach.

### **Let’s Earn with Jupiter**

Step 1: Pick Your Vault

* Head over to jup.ag/lend/earn to see the available options, like $SOL, $USDC, or $JupUSD. Take a look at the current APY and how much of the pool is currently being used (utilization).

Step 2: Make a Deposit

* Enter the amount you want to supply. The dashboard will show you what your projected earnings look like based on current rates. Once you click "Deposit" and approve the transaction in your wallet, you're all set.

Step 3: Manage Your Position

* You can track your earnings and utilization rates anytime on your dashboard. Deposits are generally liquid, though Jupiter uses a "Debt Ceiling" system to keep things running smoothly even when the market gets volatile.
