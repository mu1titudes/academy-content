## Jupiter’s Tokens & Assets

The Jupiter ecosystem utilizes a suite of specialized digital assets designed to maximize capital efficiency, provide sustainable yield, and facilitate seamless real-world utility. 

Rather than relying solely on standard market assets, Jupiter employs specific "wrappers" and native tokens \- such as JupUSDC, jupSOL, and JLP \- to align the interests of users, validators, and the protocol itself. These assets form the backbone of both the high-performance DeFi suite and the regulated Jupiter Global mode.

### **JupUSDC: The Utility Stablecoin**

JupUSDC is the core unit of account for the Jupiter ecosystem, and drives a major of the protocols within Jupiter.

* **Stable & Transparent:** [Stablecoins](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/cryptocurreny) are a unique category of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. They act as the "on-ramp" and "off-ramp" for the crypto economy, as these assets combine the speed and transparency of blockchain with the price stability of the dollar.  
* **Collateral Efficiency:** Within Jupiter's trading products, JupUSDC serves as high-quality collateral, allowing for optimized lending and borrowing rates compared to standard, idle stablecoins.  
* **Global Mode Integration:** In the [Jupiter Global](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-global) interface, your USDC is managed through this system so that any money you want to spend on your card or send home is always ready, safe, and earning rewards.

### **jupSOL: High-Performance Liquid Staking**

jupSOL is Jupiter’s native Liquid Staking Token (LST). It allows users to contribute to the security of the Solana network while maintaining the liquidity of their capital.

* **Benefits of LSTs:** An LST is a “receipt” token that represents your [staked assets](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-stake). It lets you earn staking rewards while keeping your funds "liquid" so you can trade them or use them in DeFi.  
* **Automatic Rewards:** You don't have to manage anything \- your SOL earns staking rewards automatically. Over time, each jupSOL token becomes worth slightly more than one SOL. This means your balance grows simply by holding the token.  
* **Bonus "MEV" Rewards:** jupSOL gives you a higher return than standard staking. Because it is part of the Jupiter ecosystem, it captures extra profits from network activity and shares them directly with you as a bonus.  
* **Instant Flexibility:** Usually, when you stake SOL, your money is stuck for several days. With jupSOL, your money stays free. You can use it for trading, use it as collateral, or spend it in Global Mode while it continues to earn interest in the background.

### **JLP: The Perpetuals Liquidity Token**

The Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) token represents a share in the liquidity pool that powers Jupiter’s Perpetual Exchange. It is one of the most popular yield-generating assets in the ecosystem.

* **Counterparty Mechanism:** JLP acts as the counterparty to traders on the perpetuals platform. When you hold JLP, you are providing the liquidity that traders use to open leveraged positions. In return, the JLP pool earns **75% of all fees** generated by the perpetuals exchange.  
* **Asset Composition:** JLP is not a single asset but a "basket" of high-quality tokens, typically including SOL, ETH, BTC, USDC, and USDT. This diversification provides holders with exposure to major market assets while maintaining a significant stablecoin buffer.  
* **Value Accrual:** JLP does not "pay out" yield in a traditional sense. Instead, the fees collected by the protocol are reinvested back into the pool, increasing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the JLP token. This means JLP inherently grows in value over time relative to its underlying assets as trading activity occurs.

### **JL-Tokens: Jup-Lend Yield Receipts**

[Jupiter Lending](http://academy.jup.ag/lessons/jupiter-earn) introduces JL-tokens, such as **JL-SOL** and **JL-USDC**, which represent a user's share in the lending pools. These tokens act as "yield-bearing receipts" for assets supplied to the protocol.

* **Interest Accumulation:** When you supply assets to Jup Lend, you receive JL-tokens in return. These tokens represent your principal plus the interest paid by borrowers. As interest accrues, the exchange rate of JL-tokens increases relative to the underlying asset, allowing your balance to grow passively.  
* **Productive Collateral:** One of the primary advantages of JL-tokens is their composability. Rather than leaving assets idle in a lending pool, JL-tokens can often be used as collateral in other Jupiter products, such as the perpetuals exchange, allowing users to earn lending interest and maintain trading utility simultaneously.  
* **Risk Management:** JL-tokens are protected by the protocol’s liquidation mechanics. If a borrower's collateral value drops too low, the protocol automatically liquidates their position to ensure that lenders (holders of JL-tokens) are always made whole.
