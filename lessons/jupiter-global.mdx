## Bridging Everyday Finance with Jupiter Global

Jupiter Global is the bridge between the decentralized world and everyday utility. It transforms on-chain balances (specifically stablecoins) into spendable base capital. By integrating regulated payment systems directly into the Jupiter ecosystem, it allows users to pay merchants, send fiat globally, and manage a premium crypto card without ever leaving their on-chain environment.

Historically, crypto has been an "investment layer" separated from the real economy. Jupiter Global treats your on-chain balance as a spendable base - functional digital cash.

- **KYC as a feature**: Instead of viewing compliance as a hurdle, Jupiter Global uses strong regulatory ties to unlock deep market access. This results in the most stable, local, and reliable payment experience for users.
- **Dual-Mode Interface**: The Jupiter app now features a "switch" that allows users to toggle between pure DeFi, and Global Mode.

### Key Global Features

- **Jupiter QR Pay (APAC)**: the first-ever on-chain "scan to pay" solution designed for merchants and friends across the Asia-Pacific region, with 0% fees for both consumer and merchant.
- **Jupiter Card**: a crypto credit card that bridges your USDC balance with global commerce, accepted at 150M+ merchants worldwide.
- **Global Fiat Remittance**: professional banking capabilities such as Virtual Accounts in USD, GBP, and EUR, and SWIFT support to over 200 countries.

### Jupiter ID - Your Key to Global

To facilitate the deep market access of Jupiter Global, a KYC is required to issue your card safely and comply with regulations in the countries it operates in.

- **Onboard Once**: Jupiter ID allows you to complete the compliance process once, and then never again.
- **Defi Separation**: Global & DeFi activity will remain distinct, preserving the privacy of your on-chain trading & interactions.

### Going Global with Jupiter

**Step 1: Access Global on your Jupiter App**

- Open your Jupiter App → click on top left corner “Card” icon. This switches the app to Global mode, leaving your DeFi wallets behind.

**Step 2: Complete your KYC**

- Follow the instructions on the screen. Instructions may differ depending on the country of residence.

Note: KYC approval process may take some time to complete.

**Step 3: Fund your Global account**

- Once your KYC is complete, fund your account with the “Add money” button.
